# linearBayesian
Code to use a MCMC Bayesian Inference code to fit a linear model, useful for fitting reaction orders and activation barriers from catalytic steady state kinetic data.
The GUI is used by opening "Bayesian GUI Official.ipynb" in a Jupyter Notebook.  All figures from the publication of this method as well as the raw data in .csv files is included as well.
